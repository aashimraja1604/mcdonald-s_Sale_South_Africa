## The task at hand is to create a record of McDonald's sales in South Africa for 2022 and compare them with those of 2021.
- To make the dashboard more appealing, I divided it into four sections that are interconnected.
- Section 1: The first section of the dashboard features various charts that display sales data, including a line chart comparing sales from 2021 and 2022, a doughnut chart showing the percentage of sales, and a radar chart illustrating customer satisfaction.
 
- Section 2: The second section contains all the raw data used in the dashboard, with direct links to the first section, meaning any changes made to the raw data will automatically affect the dashboard.

- Section 3: The third section provides contact information for the managers of each country in South Africa.

- Section 4: Finally, the fourth section is a mail section, allowing team members to contact me in case of any issues or queries.
## That concludes the project overview.
